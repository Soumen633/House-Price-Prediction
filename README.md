## 📝 Project Overview

This web app enables anyone to:
- Enter property details relevant to local market house prices.
- Instantly receive a predicted sale price.
- View insightful visualizations helping explain how the model reaches its predictions.

It is a learning-focused project designed to showcase transparent machine learning deployment and enable reproducible data science.

## ✨ Features

- **Guided User Inputs:** Add property features via intuitive sliders, dropdowns, and fields.
- **Instant Results:** Get predicted prices on-the-fly.
- **Visual Explanations:** Charts explain how each feature impacts the model’s estimate.
- **Reproducibility:** Complete with scripts for retraining and adapting to your own data.
- **Accessible:** Run on any OS with Python and Streamlit.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Fill in Features:** Enter details such as location, area, bedrooms, etc.
2. **Prediction Engine:** The app loads a pre-trained regression model (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) and computes the predicted price.
3. **Review Output:** See the prediction, and interpret model reasoning through feature importance and distribution plots.
